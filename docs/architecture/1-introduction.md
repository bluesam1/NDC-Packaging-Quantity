# 1) Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the NDC Packaging & Quantity Calculator, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Specification:**
This architecture document works in conjunction with `docs/front-end-spec.md`, which details the frontend-specific design, UI components, and user experience patterns. Core technology stack choices documented herein are definitive for the entire project, including frontend components.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision**: Greenfield project using standard scaffolding tools:
- SvelteKit project initialized via `npm create svelte@latest`
- Firebase project initialized via `firebase init`
- No existing codebase or starter template dependencies
