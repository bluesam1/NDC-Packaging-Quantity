    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      - ARIA attributes extensively implemented (46+ instances)
      - Focus indicators properly configured (2px solid primary-500)
      - Touch targets meet 44×44px requirement
      - Responsive breakpoints implemented correctly
      - Design tokens are WCAG AA compliant
      - Missing: Automated accessibility testing (Lighthouse, axe-core)
      - Missing: Manual screen reader testing documentation
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Responsive design uses CSS media queries efficiently. Reduced motion support implemented.'
  usability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Mobile-first approach ensures good UX across devices
      - Semantic HTML used throughout
      - Form labels and error messages properly implemented
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Design tokens centralized. Focus indicators globally defined. Good separation of concerns.'

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: 'Add automated accessibility tests using @axe-core/playwright or similar'
      refs: ['e2e/accessibility.spec.ts']
      estimated_effort: '2-4 hours'
    - action: 'Document keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features'
      refs: ['docs/accessibility.md']
      estimated_effort: '1-2 hours'
  future:
    - action: 'Perform manual screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS) and document results'
      refs: ['docs/qa/assessments/screen-reader-testing.md']
      estimated_effort: '4-6 hours'
    - action: 'Run Lighthouse accessibility audit and address any issues'
      refs: ['docs/qa/assessments/lighthouse-audit.md']
      estimated_effort: '2-3 hours'
    - action: 'Test on actual mobile devices (iOS, Android) and document findings'
      refs: ['docs/qa/assessments/device-testing.md']
      estimated_effort: '3-4 hours'

code_quality:
  strengths:
    - 'Comprehensive ARIA implementation (46+ attributes across 11 components)'
    - 'Focus indicators properly configured with WCAG AA contrast'
    - 'Design tokens centralized and well-organized'
    - 'Responsive breakpoints properly defined'
    - 'Reduced motion support implemented'
    - 'Touch targets meet minimum requirements'
  concerns:
    - 'No automated accessibility tests in test suite'
    - 'Accessibility documentation incomplete'
  architectural_notes: |
    The implementation follows best practices with:
    - Mobile-first responsive design
    - Semantic HTML usage throughout
    - Proper ARIA labeling
    - Centralized design tokens
    - Global focus indicator styles

test_coverage:
  unit: 0  # No specific accessibility unit tests
  integration: 0  # No specific accessibility integration tests
  e2e: 5  # General E2E tests, but no specific accessibility tests
  manual: 0  # No documented manual testing
  assessment: |
    E2E tests cover functional workflows but lack specific accessibility validation.
    Recommend adding:
    - Automated accessibility scans (axe-core)
    - Keyboard navigation tests
    - Focus trap tests
    - Color contrast validation
    - ARIA attribute validation
